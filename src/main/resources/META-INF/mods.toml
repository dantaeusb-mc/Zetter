Zetter is a Minecraft mod with a simple goal of adding custom drawing interface to
create and use custom pictures in Minecraft.

Core values of this mod:
1. Encourage players to create own pixel artworks and use it in their creations;
2. Do not change vanilla gameplay in any way and try to be as much close to vanilla Minecraft feel as possible;
3. Drawing should be fun and simple;
4. Let power users to be power users as much as it doesn't overcomplicate UI;
5. Server administrators should be able to easily moderate player artworks and decide what is appropriate on their server.
